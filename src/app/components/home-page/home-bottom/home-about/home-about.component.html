      <div id="about-description">Currently in my third year of Software Engineering at Polytechnique Montr√©al.
        Full-Stack development is my forte, although I do like designing Front-End and thoroughly enjoy coding
        Back-End. My hobbies include learning new technologies through personnal projects, which you can find on my
        Github!</div>
